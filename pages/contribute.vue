<p>Engineers In Action is always on the look: For innovators. For engineers. For pioneers. If you think you are one of these, come join us in our journey. Attend our meetings and tournaments, help our Bridge Design Team, raise funds for our next project, or travel with us to Bolivia for our 2019 summer project!</p> 
<p>This year in the summer of 2019, Engineers In Action will be traveling to Bolivia where we will be constructing our second footbridge. The cost required for this project will include expenses such as student travel, bridge materials, travel team training, and other essential costs. Thankfully our travel team will be larger this year however, this means our costs will also increase as well. If you wish to contribute to B2P and our mission you may donate directly to our fund through here and remember no donation is too small! We appreciate all your support and dedication to this cause, thank you.</p>
