        <p>Hi there! My name is Sarah Mah and I am a Junior studying Packaging Engineering with a minor in Fine Art. Currently, I'll be serving as EIA's Board Advisor where I help onboard new members and assist in tasks for organizing events/meetings. I joined EIA as a freshman because I was inspired by the organization's compassion and mission to make change by helping and connecting with communities. It's a rewarding experience to be a part of a caring and inclusive group! Outside of school, I enjoy spending my free time painting and listening to music. Can't wait for an amazing semester! :D </p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a senior studying Civil Engineering. I am the President of Engineers in Action. In 2021 I traveled with EIA to build a vehicular bridge in West Virginia. I joined EIA my freshman year because I saw a great opportunity to help people while pursuing my passion in engineering. Outside of the classroom I love to cook, bake, and do arts and crafts. I'm looking forward to a great last year.</p>

        <p>Hi all, my name is Cole Jenkins and I am a Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at the Rutgers School of Engineering. For this coming school year, I will be serving as the Vice President of Engineers in Action (EIA) where I have the opportunity to make a real difference in communities here and around the world! The biggest reason I joined this club was to be able to give back to others and have the reward of knowing I was able to make a big impact on the different communities we help. Outside of the engineering scope, I love hiking, skiing/snowboarding, and watching and playing a variety of sports. A final fun fact about me is my favorite show is Avatar: The Last Airbender, with my favorite character being Zuko! I look forward to seeing and working with you all this semester!</p>

        <p>Hello there! I am John O'Keefe and I am serving as the Project Manager this year. I am a junior majoring in civil engineering and this is my second year in the club after being a co-webmaster last year. I am excited to help lead the bridge design of our chapter and work closely with the travel members to ensure we build the best bridge we can. EIA has become my favorite part of college because it has allowed me to grow as a civil student, embrace new cultures and experiences, and do this all with some of the most intelligent and kindest people surrounding me. I cannot wait to see what we will accomplish this year.</p>

This year, I will be managing all digital content that we post on the EIA website. I have been working with IEEE to build a new website and I hope our website highlights some of the amazing work our organization has been involved in this past year. I joined EIA last year to meet new people and to grow my skills as an engineer. We did a fun activity where our members and I used popsicle sticks to build load-bearing bridges! Some fun facts about me: I love chocolate ice cream, biking outdoors, listening to good music, and finding new shows to watch on Netflix. I can’t wait for another awesome year with all of you!</p>
